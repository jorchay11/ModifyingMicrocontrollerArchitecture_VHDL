The objective of the project is to design components of a microcontroller using behavioral functions and descriptions in VHDL. A rudimentary microcontroller architecture and implementation was provided. It is an 8-bit microprocessor, with a 9 bit RAM address (ADDR), having 512 locations in memory. There is an 8 bit data bus (DATA), two 8-bit registers (A and B), two 8-bit input and output ports, and a 3 bit Condition Code Register (CCR). A state diagram of the provision is shown below. Each command will have an RTL description of its registersâ€™ values during each state of execution.
